# Hybrid Approach for Product Categorization, Email Sentiment Analysis, and Product Title Generation 🚀

In our innovative approach, we've harnessed the power of custom models and OpenAI to address the challenging tasks of product categorization, email sentiment analysis, and product title generation. 🧠

## Custom Model Development 🤖

For **product categorization** and **email sentiment analysis**, we've developed a custom model tailored to our unique requirements. This model allows us to precisely categorize products and analyze customer sentiments in emails. 📈

## The Perfect Dataset 📊

To construct our custom model, we needed the right dataset that aligned perfectly with our problem statement. After an exhaustive search, we stumbled upon the "Customer Support Ticket Dataset" on Kaggle, which turned out to be a goldmine for our purposes. 🕵️‍♂️

### Customer Support Ticket Dataset 💬

This remarkable dataset covers customer support tickets related to various tech products. It includes inquiries regarding hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support-related topics. 🌐💻

#### Key Information 📋

- Customer details 🧑🏽‍💼
- Product information 🛒
- Ticket types 📝
- Ticket channels 📬
- Ticket statuses ✅❌
- And other pertinent details 📊

## Access the Dataset 📦

You can access this valuable dataset using the following link: [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset). 📂

## Data Utilization 🧐

We found this dataset to be a perfect fit for modeling our problem statement, especially when dealing with customer inquiries seeking assistance. Moreover, we identified a specific ticket type for software bugs within the dataset, which became the foundation for generating emails expressing frustration and anger from customers. 🤬😡

### Leveraging OpenAI 🌐

For generating **negative sentiment emails**, we put OpenAI's capabilities to work, allowing us to create a dataset tailored to our use case. 🤯

### Creating Positive Sentiment 🌟

In contrast, for generating **positive sentiment emails** that praise product features, we again turned to OpenAI's impressive capabilities. 🙌

By combining our custom model with OpenAI's expertise, we've crafted a powerful solution to handle product categorization, email sentiment analysis, and even generate compelling product titles. 🌈💼

# 🚀 Custom Product Categorization & Email Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to our hybrid approach repository! Here, we've combined the power of custom models for product categorization and email sentiment analysis with OpenAI's capabilities for title generation.

## 📚 Dataset

To create our own model, we gathered data from the [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset) available on Kaggle. This dataset contains customer support tickets for various tech products, encompassing hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and more. It provides valuable information about the customer, product, ticket type, channel, status, and other relevant details.

We found this dataset useful for modeling our problem statement, particularly in generating data related to customer frustrations and anger (e.g., software bug tickets) and happy emails praising product features.

## 🧩 Our Approach

- **Hybrid Model**: We developed a custom model for product categorization and email sentiment analysis, harnessing the strengths of both.

- **Title Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's capabilities, we utilized title generation for certain tasks.

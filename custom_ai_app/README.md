# Hybrid Approach for Product Categorization, Email Sentiment Analysis, and Product Title Generation 🚀

Welcome to our hybrid approach repository! Here, we've combined the power of custom models for product categorization and email sentiment analysis with OpenAI's capabilities for title generation.

## Custom Model Development 🤖

For **product categorization** and **email sentiment analysis**, we've developed a custom model tailored to our unique requirements. This model is a prototype model to demonstrate product categorization and identify customer sentiments in emails. 📈

## The Perfect Dataset 📊

To construct our custom model, we needed the right dataset that aligned perfectly with our problem statement. After an exhaustive search, we stumbled upon the "Customer Support Ticket Dataset" on Kaggle, which turned out to be a goldmine for our purposes. 🕵️‍♂️

### Customer Support Ticket Dataset 💬

This remarkable dataset covers customer support tickets related to various tech products. It includes inquiries regarding hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support-related topics. 🌐💻

#### Key Information 📋

- Customer details 🧑🏽‍💼
- Product information 🛒
- Ticket types 📝
- Ticket channels 📬
- Ticket statuses ✅❌
- And other pertinent details 📊

## Access the Dataset 📦

You can access this valuable dataset using the following link: [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset). 📂

## Data Utilization 🧐

We found this dataset to be a perfect fit for modeling our problem statement, especially when dealing with customer inquiries seeking assistance. Moreover, we identified a specific ticket type for software bugs within the dataset, which became the foundation for generating emails expressing frustration and anger from customers. 🤬😡

# Data Generation Notebook 📊

In our notebooks section, you'll discover the 'data_creation_from_ticket_dataset.ipynb' notebook file. This notebook plays a crucial role in our project as it effectively utilizes the customer support ticket dataset to craft a dataset that aligns perfectly with our use case.

## Dataset Creation 📈

Upon successfully running this notebook, you'll be rewarded with the freshly minted 'product_sentiment_analysis.csv' dataset. We've conveniently organized this dataset within a dedicated 'data' folder for effortless access and seamless integration into our project.

### Leveraging OpenAI 🌐

For generating **emails expressing frustration and anger from customers** as well as **happy emails** we put OpenAI's capabilities to work, allowing us to create a dataset tailored to our use case. 🤯




By combining our custom model with OpenAI's expertise, we've crafted a prototype solution to handle product categorization, email sentiment analysis, and even generate compelling product titles. 🌈💼



## 🧩 Our Approach

- **Hybrid Model**: We developed a custom model for product categorization and email sentiment analysis, harnessing the strengths of both.

- **Title Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's capabilities, we utilized title generation for certain tasks.

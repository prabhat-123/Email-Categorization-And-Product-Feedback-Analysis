## Hybrid Approach for Product Categorization, Email Sentiment Analysis, and Product Title Generation

In our approach, we combined the strengths of custom modeling and OpenAI's capabilities to address the tasks of product categorization, email sentiment analysis, and product title generation. Below, we provide an overview of our approach and the resources we used.

### Custom Model Development

We developed a custom model to tackle product categorization and email sentiment analysis. This model was specifically tailored to our problem statement.

### Dataset Selection

To construct our custom model, we needed a relevant dataset. After an extensive search, we found an open-source dataset on Kaggle known as the "Customer Support Ticket Dataset."

#### [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset)

- This dataset encompasses customer support tickets from various tech products.
- It covers inquiries related to hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support-related topics.
- The dataset provides valuable information about the customer, the purchased product, ticket types, ticket channels, ticket statuses, and other pertinent details.

### Utilizing the Dataset

We found this dataset to be highly relevant for modeling our problem statement, particularly when dealing with customer inquiries that involved requests for assistance. Additionally, within the dataset, we identified a ticket type for software bugs, which we believed could be used to generate emails expressing frustration and anger from customers. We employed OpenAI to create a similar dataset tailored to our use case.

### Email Generation

For generating positive emails that praise product features, we harnessed the capabilities of OpenAI to create such content.

Our hybrid approach combines the strengths of custom modeling with the versatility of OpenAI, resulting in effective solutions for product categorization, email sentiment analysis, and product title generation.

# ðŸš€ Custom Product Categorization & Email Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to our hybrid approach repository! Here, we've combined the power of custom models for product categorization and email sentiment analysis with OpenAI's capabilities for title generation.

## ðŸ“š Dataset

To create our own model, we gathered data from the [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset) available on Kaggle. This dataset contains customer support tickets for various tech products, encompassing hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and more. It provides valuable information about the customer, product, ticket type, channel, status, and other relevant details.

We found this dataset useful for modeling our problem statement, particularly in generating data related to customer frustrations and anger (e.g., software bug tickets) and happy emails praising product features.

## ðŸ§© Our Approach

- **Hybrid Model**: We developed a custom model for product categorization and email sentiment analysis, harnessing the strengths of both.

- **Title Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's capabilities, we utilized title generation for certain tasks.

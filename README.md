# 📧 Email Categorization and Product Feedback Analysis (POC) 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the Email Categorization and Product Feedback Analysis POC project. This repository showcases a prototype solution designed to address the challenge of categorizing customer emails and analyzing feedback related to various software products. 💌🔍

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** Our company receives a vast number of emails from customers, covering a range of topics related to our software products, including CRM, ERP, appointment booking software, and more. These emails contain valuable insights, such as customer support requests, bug reports, and feature requests, among others. However, with millions of emails pouring in, it's becoming increasingly challenging to manually categorize and analyze them. 😓

**Objective:** The goal of this POC project is to demonstrate a solution that can automatically categorize incoming customer emails into different categories, each associated with a specific software product. Additionally, we aim to derive meaningful titles for each category, making it easier for our executive team to understand and act on the feedback. 🎯

**Scope:** This POC is a demonstration of the core concept and is not intended as a final product. It serves as a starting point for exploring the feasibility of automating email categorization and feedback analysis. 🌱

# 📧 Email Categorization and Product Feedback Analysis (POC) 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the Email Categorization and Product Feedback Analysis POC project. This repository showcases a prototype solution designed to address the challenge of categorizing customer emails and analyzing feedback related to various software products. 💌🔍

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** Our company receives a vast number of emails from customers, covering a range of topics related to our software products, including CRM, ERP, appointment booking software, and more. These emails contain valuable insights, such as customer support requests, bug reports, and feature requests, among others. However, with millions of emails pouring in, it's becoming increasingly challenging to manually categorize and analyze them. 😓

**Objective:** The goal of this POC project is to demonstrate a solution that can automatically categorize incoming customer emails into different categories, each associated with a specific software product. Additionally, we aim to derive meaningful titles for each category, making it easier for our executive team to understand and act on the feedback. 🎯

**Scope:** This POC is a demonstration of the core concept and is not intended as a final product. It serves as a starting point for exploring the feasibility of automating email categorization and feedback analysis. 🌱

## Prototype Features

The prototype includes the following key features: 🧩

1. **Email Categorization:** Incoming emails are automatically categorized into relevant software product categories. 📥🗂️

2. **Feedback Analysis:** The content of emails is analyzed to identify sentiments, such as customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 📊📈

3. **Title Generation:** Meaningful titles are derived for each category, summarizing the key feedback themes. 📌📝

## Approaches

### OpenAI Language Model
🌐 Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models (LLMs) 🌐

Recognizing the limitations of the custom model, we turned to OpenAI's powerful language models. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt engineering techniques, we were able to achieve remarkable results in email categorization and product feedback analysis. This approach demonstrates the incredible potential of AI technologies.

You can explore the source code for this approach in the `openai_app` directory.

## Results
Our Proof of Concept (POC) showcases the effectiveness of both approaches, highlighting the versatility of AI technologies in solving complex problems.

- The custom model approach provides valuable insights into the challenges of building specialized models and the importance of data quality.

- The OpenAI Language Model approach demonstrates the ease of use and impressive performance that can be achieved with cutting-edge language models.
